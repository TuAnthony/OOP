I created a header file, a source file, and I updated main to reflect the changes.

In the header file I created a window class and applied the void function tick that was already given. I then
decided to create another function called createWindow because the original main that was given was code for
creating the windows. I also moved the two structs that were originally given into the header file.

In the source/cpp file I included the two void functions; void tick and void createWindow. All the code is from
the original source and provided but now seperated into functions to make things easier.

I updated main to basically allow you to just use main to run the program which is the game of snake. Created 
a object called win for windows.
