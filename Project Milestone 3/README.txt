OOP Milestone 3

In this milestone, I had to extend the game by adding new features and the suggested new feature to add was new
kinds of food so I added that. I did this by making core abstraction of things that were already in the game. The
abstraction that I came up with is to make the snake faster once a certain color or "case" was consumed by the
snake. I determined the type of food that was consumed by the snake by using the length of the snake to determine
the type of food.

I added the colors: blue, maroon, purple, and yellow.

I also added srand/number generator so I can rotate the snake food color by making it so the snake can eat
different pieces.
