This version of game of war uses implementation that I learned in class. I had to implement a compact representation
of my card class by using different representation of a suit and a rank in a 8-bit integer. I also decided to
use the code from gitlab that was provided as the code was very well orgranized and it was seperated with a
header file, a compilation file, and a main file. I also overloaded my operators and used std::shuffle which
I learned from lecture. My main file contains only what is neccesary to run and my header file contains the classe,
enum, structs, and overloaded operators.
